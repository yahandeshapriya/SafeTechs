SafeTechs 
(IoT-Based Accident Detection & Alerting System)

South Asian countries like Sri Lanka, need to absorb digital technologies and are required to update the necessary manual business procedures in government or non-government sectors to an automated system for the purpose of boosting the required procedures. I hope the proposed system will encourage policymakers and other political leaders in Sri Lanka to utilize these types of automated systems. When going to talk about the proposed project blueprint, the purpose of creating this system is to develop the current manual rescue operating & road safety procedure in Sri Lanka into an automated system by utilizing IT and IoT technologies. "SafeTechs" is the business name of the proposed system. This platform will connect all the important rescue and other relevant parties into one digital platform to accomplish their tasks by utilizing this system. Furthermore, this proposed system will boost the current manual procedure, and it will save time in rescue operation missions plus this planned system will help to minimize the death & injury ratios to a certain level which are caused by vehicle accidents in Sri Lanka.

This system consists of two main components, namely, an IoT-Based device and a web application. In addition, the system utilizes Firebase as a database to store data/information & to accomplish other relevant tasks. The planned IoT-Based device uses many sensors and other relevant components like an Arduino UNO board, two NodeMCU ESP8266 boards, NEO 6M GPS module, an Accelerometer (ADXL 335 MEMS), an Alcohol sensor (MQ-3), an MQ2 gas sensor, a Flame sensor, an Electromagnetic door lock, a 5V 1 channel relay module, a mini buzzer, an Arduino car kit, a Piezo sensor, two mini push button switches, a LED light and Jumper wires  (Male to Male, Male to Female & Female to Female). Furthermore, to power up this device, I utilize 5V & 12V power sources and two 3.7V rechargeable battery cells (1200mAh). and also, the proposed web application was created by utilizing React, Node.js, Express.js and other relevant web technologies and mechanisms. This proposed web platform was designed according to professional standards and other relevant accepts.

I have developed the proposed system by focusing on Sri Lankan consumers (Sri Lankan audience). In future, I would like to expand and improve this proposed system by focusing global market accepts.
