SafeTechs (IoT-Based Accident Detection & Alerting System)

The purpose of creating this system is to develop a rescue operating system in Sri Lanka by utilizing IT and IoT technologies. "SafeTechs" is the business name of the proposed system. This platform will connect all the important rescue and other relevant parties into one digital platform to accomplish their tasks by utilizing this system. Furthermore, this proposed system will help to minimize the death & injury ratios to certain level which are caused by vehicle accidents in Sri Lanka.

This system consists of two main components, namely, an IoT-Based device and a web application. In addition, the system utilizes Firebase as a database to store data/information & to accomplish other relevant tasks. The planned IoT-Based device uses many sensors and other relevant components like Arduino Uno board, NEO 6M GPS module, NodeMCU ESP8266, MQ2 Gas sensor, Flame sensor, buzzer, etc. and also, the proposed web application was created by utilizing React, Node.js, Express.js and other relevant web technologies and mechanisms.

I have developed the proposed system by focusing on Sri Lankan consumers. In future, I would like to expand and improve the system by focusing global market.
