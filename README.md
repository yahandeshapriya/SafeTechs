The purpose of creating this system is to develop the current road safety & manual rescue operating procedures in Sri Lanka by utilizing IT and IoT technologies. "SafeTechs" is the business name of the proposed system. This platform will connect all the important rescue and other relevant parties into one digital platform to accomplish their tasks by utilizing this system.
